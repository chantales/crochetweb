    "Hello!! I'm Chantale. 
    <br>
    I'm 14 years old and I love to craft! I originally learnt to cross-stitch around 2020, and somehow ended up learning to knit. One day, I was tired of knitting and decided to try to crochet. To put it simply, it went bad. I messed it up and lost all hope. One day in 2022 I decided to suck it up and try again. My first actual project was basically falling apart, but I could crochet, who cares!
    <br>
    After that, I started to crochet a lot more, and honestly I'm so glad I didn't drop it completely because I didn't realize how useful it was. I can make literally anything I want now. But, I will always love to make little dinosaurs and give them tophats."

  "Hi! I'm Shantel. 
<br>
  I'm 15 years old and I learned how to crochet when I was around the age of 8, from my mum. I had always been a loom band type of kid so I enjoyed crochet. I knew all the basics but, for some reason, all my scarves ended up being tilted. I ended up giving up. 
  
  Sometimes I would pick the hobby up again and give it another shot- though it was short lived. In the summer of 2021, I picked it up again and crocheted a patchwork cardigan. This is what motivated me to keep crocheting. 
  <br>
  Nowadays I use textile arts to express myself and my interests. My favorite things to crochet are plushies, especially with chunky yarn! As well as crochet I can do tunisian crochet, french knitting, cross stitching and sometimes I sew. (by sewing machine and hand)"
